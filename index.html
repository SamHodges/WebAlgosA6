      <h1>Animated Convex Hull Demo</h1>
      <p>Click on the box below to add points. 
        After you have a couple of points on the screen, you can start playing with the buttons below. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Clicking on <b>Start</b> primes the site to iterate through the points by sorting them by x-coordinate, using height as a tie breaker should any two x-coordinates be equal. 
        <br />
        Clicking on <b>Step</b> checks the highlighted point as the first of a three-point turn- each of the steps in the following sequence would count as ONE step:
        <br />
        1. if said turn moves right, the point will be connected by a line to the following point. 
        <br />
        2. Wherever there is no right turn, the algorithm backtracks (1 <b>Step</b> at a time) until there is another path to take. 
        <br />
        The button <b>Full Animation</b> iterates through all the steps in one go. 
        <br />
        Click <b>Stop Animation</b> to stop the next step in the hull animation.</p>
