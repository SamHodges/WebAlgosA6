      <h1>Animated Convex Hull Demo</h1>
      <p>Click on the box below to add points. 
        After you have a couple of points on the screen, you can start playing with the buttons below. </p>

        <p>Clicking on <b>Start</b> primes the site to iterate through the points by sorting them by x-coordinate, using height as a tie breaker should any two x-coordinates be equal. 
        </p><p>
        Clicking on <b>Step</b> checks the highlighted point as the first of a three-point turn:
        </p><p>
        1. if said turn moves left, the point will be connected by a line to the following point. 
        </p><p>
        2. Wherever there is no left turn, the algorithm backtracks (1 <b>Step</b> at a time) until there is another path to take. 
        </p><p>
        The button <b>Full Animation</b> iterates through all the steps in one go. 
        </p><p>
        Click <b>Stop Animation</b> to stop the next step in the hull animation.</p>
        <p>You can also delete nodes (before starting the algorithm) or check if a point is within the convex hull (after finishing the algorithm).</p>
